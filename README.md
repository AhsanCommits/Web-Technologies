    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>To take this course, students should have a basic understanding of programming concepts and be familiar with at
        least
        one programming language. Knowledge of HTML and CSS is also helpful, but not required.</p>
    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. In this section, you
        will
        learn the basics of HTML, including tags, attributes, and elements. You will also learn how to create forms,
        tables,
        and lists.</p>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in
        HTML. In this section, you will learn the basics of CSS, including selectors, properties, and values. You will
        also
        learn how to use CSS to style text, create layouts, and add animations.</p>
    <h3>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers. In this section,
            you
            will learn the basics of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, and objects. You will also
            learn how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript.</p>
        <h3>jQuery</h3>
        <p>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal
            and
            manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a
            multitude
            of browsers. In this section, you will learn how to use jQuery to simplify your JavaScript code.</p>
        <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
        <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web
            development.
            It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other
            interface components. In this section, you will learn how to use Bootstrap to create responsive websites.
        </p>
        <h3>React</h3>
        <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a declarative and efficient way to
            create
            reusable UI components, and is used by many popular web applications, including Facebook, Instagram, and
            Airbnb.
            In this section, you will learn how to use React to create dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>
        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment. It enables JavaScript to
            be
            used for server-side scripting, and runs scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the
            page
            is sent to the user's web browser. In this section, you will learn how to use Node.js to build web
            applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Express.js</h2>
            <p>Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features
                for
                building web and mobile applications. In this section, you will learn how to use Express.js to create
                web
                APIs and handle HTTP requests and responses.</p>
            <h3>MongoDB</h3>
            <p>MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. It uses JSON-like documents with optional
                schemas, and provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data. In this section,
                you
                will learn how to use MongoDB to store data for your web applications.</p>
            <h3>Next.js [Optional]</h3>
            <p>Next.js is a popular React framework that provides server-side rendering and static site generation for
                your
                web applications. It makes it easy to create optimized and performant web applications with React, and
                is
                used by many popular websites, including Hulu and Uber. In this section, you will learn how to use
                Next.js
                to build web applications that are optimized for performance and SEO.</p>
